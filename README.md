DRUMS
=====

DRUMS is a key-value store, which is optimized for:
 1. fast bulk inserts, 
 2. fast state dependent updates 
 3. range selects

DRUMS was first developed to store sequence related data, but it can be easily adapted for other problems, e.g. product informations, click data, ... . DRUMS is very memory efficient. To find an example for sequence related data, please have a look at the [BioDRUMS](https://github.com/mgledi/BioDRUMS) project.
